		<p>There are two components to Safe Light. The first part is within the car and can be accessed through the navigation system. The main function of this component is to receive information from the network and relay it to the driver through various methods such as visual and audio signals.</p>

		<p>The second component is a network based on the latest cellular network technology which connects all the traffic lights and delivers information to the navigation system in the car. When a car is approaching a yellow light, the duration of the light is sent to the navigation system which is then relayed to the driver. If the car is stopped at a red light, the remaining duration is also relayed to driver. In the event of a nearby emergency vehicle, the driver will receive the location of the vehicle so that he/she can take the proper measures if necessary. </p>
