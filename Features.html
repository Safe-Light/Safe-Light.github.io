				Approaching an intersection as the traffic light turns yellow can be a stressful experience.
				In only a split second we expect drivers to calculate whether they should attempt to stop or continue through the intersection.
				Making the wrong choice could result in an unsafely abrupt stop or driving through a red light. 
				Safe Light lightens the load by making this calculation for you, helping you be a better, safer driver.

		  <div id="nextGreen" class ="content">
			 <h3> Countdown until the next green light</h3>
			 <p> 
				Not a lot is more irritating when driving then waiting for a traffic light that just won’t turn green. While we can’t change when it’s your turn, we can make it a more predictable experience. 
				Safe Light displays a countdown until the next green light corresponding to your lane, determined by your car’s signal.

			 <h3> Mutes audio when an emergency vehicle is approching </h3>
			 <p> 
				Safe Light is capable of communicating with more than just traffic lights. The same communication technology we put in traffic lights can also be put in emergency vehicles. 
				This allows Safe Light to mute the car`s audio and play a warning noise when a police car, firetruck or ambulance is approaching.
				Safe Light then improves safety for those who aren’t even on the road by helping emergency responders get to them faster.
