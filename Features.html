<h3> Warn you when you are about to hit a yellow light</h3>
<p>SafeLight is capable of calculating weather or not it is safe to continue through a yellow light or weather it would be preferable to stop.
This warning would help reduce drivers' anxiety and prevent poor decision making that could cause a driver to run a red light</p>
</div>

<div id="nextGreen" class ="content">
<h3> Countdown until the next green light</h3>
<p> Safelight, being connected to nearby traffic lights, is able to display the time in seconds until your next green light. This makes intersections a more predictable experience</p>
</div>

<div id="muteAudio" class="content">
<h3> Mutes audio when an emergency vehicle is approching </h3>
<p> SafeLight can detect nearby emergency vehicles. SafeLight mutes all car audio, when an emergy vehicle is in range. SafeLight could then be an important tool for first responders.</p>
