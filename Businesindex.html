			<h1>The Market</h1>
			<p>Autonomous driving has not fully entered the market yet, therefore creating an opportunity for our project to succeed. There is around a 10-15 year gap before autonomous driving will be availible for the public, and even then might not be affordable or practical for the average consumer. Moreover, with this being said, SafeLight, would be an essential feature for keeping the average driver safe from car crashes at intersections. </p>

			<h1>Our Possible Clients</h1>
			<p>The premise of our project is to create a business to business product that would create a safe and beneficial feature to most modern cars on the road. Most car companies, including but not limited to Toyota, Honda, Mercedes and BMW have displays in their cars/dashboards to assist drivers while driving. Moreover, this feature would not be hard to implement in an already solid state of technology inbedded in many cars. In addition, this feature could possibly increase the value of cars because of the decrease of occuring accidents. In short, our clients can be a variety of car companies while the world waits for the creation of autonomous driving that is affordable and accessible for all.</p>
