         <h3> Why is our product ready for the current car market?</h3>
         <p> 
            Autonomous driving has not fully entered the market yet, therefore creating an opportunity for our project to succeed. There is around a 10-15 year gap before autonomous driving will be availible for the public, and even then might not be affordable or practical for the average consumer. Moreover, with this being said, SafeLight, would be an essential feature for keeping the average driver safe from car crashes at intersections.
