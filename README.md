# Essentially our product, Safe-Light, would be an in-car program that would help drivers make the correct decision when approaching a changing traffic light. Many people misjudge yellow lights when approaching an intersection and Safe-Light would insure the driver has all the required information to make the correct decision. This would drastically decrease the amount of accidents caused by traffic lights, saving lives. Other features would include decreasing the volume when emergency vehicles are nearby, and notify the driver of any accidents in the area.
