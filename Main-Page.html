	  		Safe-Light is a state of the art in-car program that would assist drivers to make the correct decision when approaching a changing traffic light. Many people misjudge yellow lights when approaching an intersection and Safe-Light would insure the driver has all the required information to make the correct decision.

	  		How do we solve this?
	  	</h2>
	  	<p>
	  		 Safe-Light would drastically decrease the amount of accidents caused by traffic lights, saving lives. With almost all accidents able to be avoided, Safe-light is the next step in car safety. Other features would include decreasing the volume when emergency vehicles are nearby, and notify the driver of any accidents in the area.
