			<h1>What is Safe Light?</h1>
			<p>Safe-Light is a state of the art in-car program that would assist drivers to make the correct decision when approaching a changing traffic light. Many people misjudge yellow lights when approaching an intersection and Safe-Light would insure the driver has all the required information to make the correct decision. </p>
			<h1>How do we solve this?</h1>
			<p>Safe-Light would drastically decrease the amount of accidents caused by traffic lights, saving lives. With almost all accidents able to be avoided, Safe-light is the next step in car safety. Other features would include decreasing the volume when emergency vehicles are nearby, and notify the driver of any accidents in the area.</p>

				Approaching an intersection as the traffic light turns yellow can be a stressful experience.
				In only a split second we expect drivers to calculate whether they should attempt to stop or continue through the intersection.
				Making the wrong choice could result in an unsafely abrupt stop or driving through a red light. 
				Safe Light lightens the load by making this calculation for you, helping you be a better, safer driver.

			 <h3> Countdown until the next green light</h3>
			 <p> 
				Not a lot is more irritating when driving then waiting for a traffic light that just won’t turn green. While we can’t change when it’s your turn, we can make it a more predictable experience. 
				Safe Light displays a countdown until the next green light corresponding to your lane, determined by your car’s signal.

			 <h3> Mutes audio when an emergency vehicle is approching </h3>
			 <p> 
				Safe Light is capable of communicating with more than just traffic lights. The same communication technology we put in traffic lights can also be put in emergency vehicles. 
				This allows Safe Light to mute a car's audio when a police car, firetruck or ambulance is approaching.
				Our product improves safety even for those who aren’t on the road by helping first responders get where they need to be faster.
